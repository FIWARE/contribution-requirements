== How to add Google Analytics to Read the Docs ==

This guide explains how to add Google Analytics to the documentation generated by Read the Docs and how to set up the Google Analytics to allow access for the fiware.community account.

=== Create a Google Analytics property ===
Google Analytics properties allow to track web-pages visits and other information. The process for creating a new property differs slightly depending if you have a Google Analytics account or not.

==== Create new property without having a Google Analytics account ====
If you don’t have a Google Analytics account, you can create one on http://analytics.google.com, a Google account is required. Once logged in with your Google account, you will see a page similar to this :

You need to click on Sign up.


You will directly land on the account creation page. In this page you will also need to create the new property to be monitored. You should fill the '''Account Name''' field with the desired value and, on the '''Setting up your property''' section, you should fill the required information:

* '''Website Name''': The name of the page that you are going to monitor.
*''' Website URL''': The URL of the Read the Docs generated site.
* '''Industry Category''': The category of the project.
* '''Reporting Time Zone''': The Time Zone that will be used in the generated reports.

Once all the information is provided, you should click '''Get Tracking ID'''.


After the creation of the property, it is ready to use. Google Analytics have some examples of how the property can  be used but we will use the Tracking ID directly. '''Annotate the Tracking ID''' because it will be used later.

==== Create new property having a Google Analytics account ====

If you already have a Google Analytics account, from the''' Admin''' section, with the desired account  selected, you should select “'''Create new property'''” in the column named '''PROPERTY'''.

=== Provide access to fiware.community account ===
From the property section, you simply should select '''User Management''' on the left menu. Once in the User Management section, you can add the '''fiware.eu@gmail.com''' filling the information as can be seen in the image below. Then simply click on Add. Ensure that the email address is correct, all permissions are provided and the option '''Notify this user by email''' is checked.

=== Set up Read the Docs === 

The easiest way to enable Google Analytics for your documentation is to add the following line to your '''mkdocs.yml''' file:

<code>google_analytics: ['google analytics track ID', 'your site ur']</code>

An example for the Tourguide should be:

<code>google_analytics: ['UA-79939750-3', 'fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io']</code>

You can follow as example the docs.Tourguide configuration file: https://github.com/Fiware/docs.TourGuide/blob/master/mkdocs.yml#L6

'''Note:''' You should push the changes to your repository in order to start tracking your documentation.
