## Configuring webhook in a FIWARE GitHub repository

According to the [mission statement](https://www.fiware.org/foundation/) of the
FIWARE Foundation, the Foundation promotes FIWARE related assets across several
locations, such as [fiware.org](http;//fiware,org),
[ReadtheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/).

To keep the message on GitHub focused, the Foundation restricts the main
[github.com/FIWARE](https://github.com/fiware/) account to assets (such as Data
Models, Specifications and Tutorials) owned by the Foundation itself. For the
Generic Enablers, mirror copies of the source code are hosted under a separate
[github.com/FIWARE-GEs](https://github.com/fiware-ges) account in order to
maintain infrastructure, QA and statistics. Creating a mirror for each
repository is required as part of the incubation process.

In order to connect your repository with the mirror webhook you simply have to
follow these steps:

-   In your repository page, click **Settings**.
