### Badges

This document is a recommendation on the usage of badges in FIWARE Projects.
Badges are small graphical labels which provide a visual aid to understand
different aspects about a project. Badges can be easily generated by using
[Shields.io](http://shields.io/). Where Shields.io already offers a badge it
should be used in preference to other badges.

GitHub repositories `README.md` **MUST** include the following badges at the
very beginning of the document:

-   ![.](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/badges/chapters/iot-agents.svg) -
    **FIWARE Chapter** (Link to https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/ )
    Example:
    `https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/badges/chapters/iot-agents.svg` -
    the full link includes the logo.
-   ![.](https://img.shields.io/github/license/telefonicaid/fiware-orion.svg) -
    **License** - (Link to the OSS License under the component is offered)
    Example:
    `https://img.shields.io/github/license/telefonicaid/fiware-orion.svg`
    Example: `https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/fiware-orion.svg`
-   ![.](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/24/badge) - **CII
    Best Practices Badge**
-   ![.](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fiware/orion.svg)- **Docker**
    (pointer to the Docker container at the Docker Hub Repository) Example:
    `https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/fiware/orion.svg`
-   Optional Support badges (e.g. Stack Overflow) - see below
-   A new line character `<br/>`
-   ![.](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/fiware-orion.svg) -
    **Documentation** (pointer to the documentation on readthedocs corresponding
    to the branch) Example:
    `https://img.shields.io/badge/support-askbot-yellowgreen.svg`
-   ![.](https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/repository/raw/public/static/badges/statuses/keyrock.svg) -
    **GE Status** - to show active support for a repository Example:
    `https://nexus.lab.fiware.org/static/badges/statuses/orion.svg`

GitHub repositories `README.md` **SHOULD** list either of the following support
badges at the beginning of the document (where relevant):

-   ![ ](https://img.shields.io/badge/tag-fiware--orion-orange.svg?logo=stackoverflow) -
    **Stack Overflow** tag (pointer to the Stack Overflow support channel)
    Example:
    `https://img.shields.io/badge/tag-fiware--orion-orange.svg?logo=stackoverflow`
-   ![ ](https://img.shields.io/badge/support-askbot-yellowgreen.svg) -
    **Support** (pointer to the support channel, askbot, which can be used to
    get support if Stack Overflow is not used) or alternatively include links to
    other relevant support channels.

The idea being that the first row of badges is informational, the second row
displays the state of the project. The second row of badges should ideally all
be **GREEN** at all times.
