## Checklist for publishing FIWARE Generic Enablers

This checklist is intended to inform new FIWARE GE owners of the steps that have
to be taken in order to publish a new FIWARE GE.

Any doubt or request to the FIWARE Foundation shall be made by sending an email
to [fiware-help@lists.fiware.org](mailto:fiware-help@lists.fiware.org)

### New Generic Enablers

The following mimimal requirements must be met before a new contribution can be
considered as an Incubated Generic Enabler. The acceptance can take time, for
instance to allow studying the quality of the product, internal architecture,
software design, code cleanliness etc.

-   All New Generic Enablers **MUST** be presented to the TSC for candidature
    and accepted into an existing Chapter.
-   A New Generic Enabler **MUST** show how it integrates within the overall
    FIWARE Architecture
-   The codebase **MUST** be available on [GitHub](https://github.com)
-   The GitHub repository **MUST** include an appropriate Open Source License
-   For functional readiness at a minimum, a new incubated enabler **MUST** be
    able to be instantiated directly in a running state by any competent
    developer without the need to refer to other dependent technologies - for
    example:

    -   [Keyrock](https://fiware-idm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) relies on MySQL,
        but a working MySQL can be easily instantiated by Docker and minimal
        data is seeded by Keyrock - the database volume can be persisted.
        Knowledge of SQL is unnecessary for use.
    -   An [IoT Agent](https://iotagent-node-lib.rtfd.io/) can have a dependency
        on MongoDB - the volumes are exposed so that the data will be persisted
        if the Docker container goes down. Alternatively an IoT Agent can be
        memory based, but all configuration can be set up using a config file or
        Docker params and then data injected by HTTP requests. An understanding
        of MongoDB is unnecessary to get it to work.
    -   [QuantumLeap](https://quantumleap.rtfd.io/) works with Grafana and
        Crate-DB - appropriate set-up and docker compose are available in the
        Quick Start. Quantum Leap can be used without in depth knowledge of
        Crate-DB

-   For all webservice components, a
    [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) **MUST** be
    available within the code-base
-   Basic documentation **MUST** exist in Markdown and **MUST** be complete
    enough for usage of the component:
    -   A Quick Start guide
    -   Admin Installation instructions - how to create instances:
        -   Standalone using configuration files
        -   Using Docker/Docker-compose and injecting `ENV` variables
    -   Developer Documentation - how to call the API programmatically
    -   User Documentation - how to use the GUI
    -   Apiary file (where necessary)
-   For a stateful component, the state **MUST** be persistable between
    instantiations, additional manual set-up **MUST** not be required.
-   There **MUST** be a commitment that the team behind the product will follow
    through with completing the remaining Incubated requirements within a
    reasonable time frame

#### Submission Checklist

The following information **MUST** be submitted to FF Staff:

-   The URL of all of the GitHub Repositories holding the code base
-   The version number of the initial release to be included in the catalogue -
    this **MUST** correspond to a real release tag found on the GitHub
    repository
-   The location of the official `Dockerfile`, so an “official” FIWARE docker
    image can be set up from the FIWARE account
-   The URL for the official documentation - ideally this URL should be a
    **ReadtheDocs** project
-   The name of a representative who will take the role of the owner/caretaker
    of the Generic Enabler.
-   A sample **elevator pitch** (one sentence) and the **What is?** and **Why
    use?** texts (one paragraph each) describing the GE in the same manner as
    the other Generic Enablers

    -   Example -
        [Elevator Pitches](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/)
    -   Example -
        [What is text?](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/blob/master/core/README.md#what-is-orion)
    -   Example -
        [Why Use text?](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/blob/master/core/README.md#why-use-orion)

### Incubated

The expected requirements to be fulfilled within a few months of acceptance:

-   New entry in the
    [FIWARE Catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/) under the
    corresponding Chapter agreed at TSC Level. See also
    [Working with the FIWARE catalogue](https://wiki.fiware.org/Working_with_the_FIWARE_catalogue)
-   Mirroring GitHub Webhook properly configured. See
    [webhooks](repo_webhook.md) (Ask FF to configure the mirroring).
-   **ReadtheDocs** project available and styled using the FIWARE CSS and
    Chapter CSS. See
    [fiware-orion.readthedocs.org](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.org) as an
    example.
-   Automatic documentation generation **MUST** be configured. See
    [mkdocs.yml](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/blob/master/mkdocs.yml)
    as a reference on how to configure **ReadtheDocs**
-   Analytics **MUST** be configured for the **ReadtheDocs** portal as described
    by [analytics](analytics_readthedocs.md)
-   Docker image **MUST** be available in
    [FIWARE's Dockerhub account](https://hub.docker.com/Dockerhub)
-   Roadmap **MUST** be available at one of the following:
    -   Promoted on GitHub and linked in the
        [Current Roadmap](https://wiki.fiware.org/Current_Supported_Features_and_Roadmap_in_FIWARE)
    -   Promoted in a publicly available document on the web and linked at
        [Current Roadmap](https://wiki.fiware.org/Current_Supported_Features_and_Roadmap_in_FIWARE)
    -   Full text found within the
        [Current Roadmap](https://wiki.fiware.org/Current_Supported_Features_and_Roadmap_in_FIWARE)
-   Release schedule **MUST** be aligned with
    [release requirements](GE_Requirements.md#releases)
-   Access **MUST** be provided to the corresponding information in order to see
    your component reflected in the [ monitoring
    tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yyZNUlAPDcqjnD-gIoGOd5SZfVDJXO36G75xTDL0HgA/edit#gid=0
    FIWARE - TSC Enablers Dashboard) (Ask FF Staff)

It is accepted that Incubated Enablers may not currently comply with all
"**MUST**" requirements of the [Development Guidelines](development.md), but are
expected to be working towards fulfilling them. Commitment to completing the
transition to a full member is tracked as part of the FIWARE Quality Assurance
testing, and insufficient progress on issues will eventually result in the
enabler being quarantined or be removed from the list of Enablers.

#### Transition to Full membership

All of the "**MUST**" requirements of the
[Development Guidelines](development.md) must be fulfilled before the incubation
period is complete.

The enabler should have demonstrated that it fulfills a real need within the
FIWARE ecosystem, and statitics showing a credible level of adoption and
community support **MUST** be presented to the TSC.

### Mature (Full Member)

This is the expected standard for membership going onward. All the requirements
for new and incubated enablers listed above **MUST** be met.

-   All FIWARE Development (**MUST**) Guidelines are met. See
    [Development Guidelines](development.md)

> To further clarify, failure to do so will result in a written warning and a
> requirement to comply within a given period of time. Mature Generic Enablers
> which make no effort to fulfill the gaps in their commitments, will be
> quarantined and will be removed from the list of Enablers.

-   A Stack Overflow tag for the component is registered (Ask FF Staff)
-   Where it is suitable to provide a global instance of a service, a public
    instance may be deployed in the FIWARE Lab and maintained by the FF team
    (Ask FF Staff)
-   A tour guide entry is provided - see [fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io]
    https://fiwaretourguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/iot-agents/introduction/)
-   A tutorial is provided (See some examples at
    [fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io](http://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest))
