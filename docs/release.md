A "FIWARE release" contains versioned releases of all Generic Enablers found
within the [catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/). All
components must work seamlessly with the
[FIWARE Context Broker](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion/releases/latest)
and each other.

The following timetable is proposed for a typical FIWARE release cycle. It is
assumed that two releases a year will occur to be aligned with the biannual
FIWARE Summits. Furthermore, some interim releases may also be required to align
with roadmap milestones. Even at the most frequent, releases are not expected to
occur more often than once a month.

## Release Prerequisites

Additional GE development for each release cycle should close by the beginning
of the month - ideally this should mean that all code the development team
wishes to include in the FIWARE release has been:

-   Written
-   Tested (both functional and integration tests)
-   Documented
-   Labelled as a [SemVer release](GE_Requirements.md#releases) on **GitHub**

Any proposed [new entries](GE_Checklist.md#new-generic-enablers) to the
catalogue **MUST** have been presented to the TSC.

Any component
[transitioning to a full member](GE_Checklist.md#transition-to-full-membership)
of the catalogue **MUST** have completed all "Must" requirements and have been
presented as such to the TSC.

## Release timetable

#### Week 1

**Day 1** - The formal commencement of the release process will be announced
during the **first** TSC meeting of the month.

-   A list of release candidates will be collated for the TSC and created in a
    prerelease candidate list on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/releases)
-   For each Generic Enabler
    -   The latest tagged **GitHub** release is assumed to part of the current
        release cycle unless explicitly informed otherwise in writing.
    -   Where no release is found, the latest tag will be proposed.
    -   Where no tags are found, the latest hash will be proposed.
-   On this basis all GE Owners should immediately either:
    -   Double tag their **existing** approved release version in their GitHub
        repository with `FIWARE_<major>.<minor>`
    -   Send an eMail to FF staff requesting a time extension and propose a new
        version number for inclusion in the release.

#### Week 2

**Day 8** - Any changes to the list created above must be received no later than
the **second** TSC meeting of the month.

-   Proposed new catalogue additions.
-   Proposed transitions to full member status etc.
-   Alterations to the version numbers listed.

Where any further adjustments have been requested, they must be completed within
**three days** of the **second** TSC meeting of the month - i.e. **Day 11**. -
for example:

-   For new entrants, the
    [Minimal Checklist](GE_Checklist.md#new-generic-enablers) for new Generic
    Enablers to be completed.
-   For all Generic Enablers, any missing **GitHub** release tags a new version
    number added.
-   Any other alterations to the codebase completed.

#### Week 3

**Day 15** - The release will be closed with final fixed versions on the
**third** TSC meeting of the month.

-   The finalized list of release enablers for release `FIWARE_<major>.<minor>`
    will added as a tagged release on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/Fiware/catalogue/releases).
-   The prerelease candidates list on **GitHub** will be deleted.
-   Generic Enabler owners who had requested more time should double tag the
    release version in their **GitHub** repository with
    `FIWARE_<major>.<minor>`.
